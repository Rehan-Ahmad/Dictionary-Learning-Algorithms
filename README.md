Main File: **Dictionary_Learning_v2.py** <br />

This file execute all the algorithms consisting of Gradient Descent based Dictionary Learning (variants), KSVD, MOD and SimCo. <br />
It will plot the error curve after comparing the original and learned Dictionary on the synthetic Dataset. <br />

Implementation of Dictionary Learning algorithms on real data can be found in DenoiseImage folder. It uses learned dictionary for image denoising.
